## First Days of Iskra Delta

Before Iskra Delta, a state-run company named Elektrotehna specialised in selling electrotechnical products to Yugoslav companies. In 1977 the department outgrew its original purpose and became
an independent and specialised computer company named Delta, while still under the
jurisdiction of Elektrotehna. 

In 1978 Delta separated itself from Elektrotehna and started linking up with Iskra and Gorenje
to form a company named Iskra Delta. The personnel coming into the company from Iskra
enabled it to grow at an even higher pace, so much so it soon had its own sales and repairs
centres all across Yugoslavia. Their success was based on their efforts to form a close
relationship with users of their products. The resourcefulness of the company’s leadership
soon saw them achieve success after success in Yugoslavia and abroad, where it cooperated
with Great Britain, the United States of America, India, Austria, and most notably China, who
they helped by establishing a network connecting 10 police stations in the country’s largest
cities. Despite a long list of successful projects, political tensions and extreme economic
conditions in late 1980s Yugoslavia led to the surprising and to this day not fully clarified
downfall of Iskra Delta.

## The Impact of Iskra Delta
The personnel coming into the company from Iskra enabled it to grow at an even higher pace. So
much so it soon had its own sales and repairs centres all across Yugoslavia. Their success was
based on their efforts to form a close relationship with the users of their products.

As early as 1980, Iskra Delta founded a New York delegation and made contacts with
American suppliers, and so was in touch with the latest achievements in development in the
Silicon Valley. The firm developed two new computers, Partner and Triglav (in international
markets known as Trident), and in 1984 became the first to realise a project of a computer
managing and running a hydroelectric power station from a distance. Its computers were also
involved in the realisation of sporting events, such as ski jumping in Planica, skiing
competitions in Kranjska Gora and Maribor, and the Winter Universiade in Czechoslovakia.
Their cooperation granted the events full informational support, a record of participants, and
the collecting and distribution of results at different locations.
During their peak years, the company conscientiously presented their products at Interbiro
fairs in Ljubljana and Zagreb and thus attracted many foreign clients. It was at such a fair in

1984 that Iskra Delta’s products enthralled representatives of the People’s Republic of China,
who wanted to collaborate on a project which would connect the police stations of the ten
largest cities in China via computer. Iskra Delta agreed to the cooperation and in 1986
successfully realised the enormous project. While the project bonded the two countries and
was the largest purchase China had ever made in Yugoslavia, it experienced certain
complications. This cooperation between Yugoslavia and China also attracted the attention of
Chinese and other eastern countries’ intelligence services.
