# Elektrotehna
In 1970s Yugoslavia a state-run company named Elektrotehna was specialised in selling
electrotechnical products to Yugoslav companies. Elektrotehna linked up with American
company DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation) with the goal of selling computers across
Yugoslavia. A department of Elektrotehna was renamed to Digital and specialised in selling
computers for managing industrial processes and institutes of development, and later also
devices for managing business procedures. In 1977 the department outgrew its original
purpose and became a specialised and independent computer company named Delta, while
still under the jurisdiction of Elektrotehna.
