# The Delta educational centre

The Delta Educational Centre was opened in Nova Gorica in the autumn of 1985 when the abandoned Agronavti hotel was renovated. The Centre was made up of three sections – hotel, education, and recreation. The hotel section held 200 beds, while the educational part of the Centre was divided into management facilities, instructors’ offices, and 20 classrooms which held 350 seats in total. All the classrooms were equipped with terminals, computers, or other suitable devices and learning equipment. The recreational segment included a pool, sauna, and tennis courts. 
A seminar course usually took place for 5 days, with the centre holding between 7 and 11 seminars a week for 100–200 students. The Centre’s own staff of experts was in charge of the modern educational process placing great importance on the students interacting with a computer. The seminars were both theoretical and practical. The theoretical part of the learning process took place in classrooms equipped with up-to-date technology featuring overhead projectors and monitors connected to the instructor’s terminal. The practical lessons focused on using the computer system and were organised in an individualistic way in up-to-date interactive classrooms. Only 2 students at a time worked on each individual video-terminal, which enabled collective work with participants exchanging information, while still enabling each individual to obtain as much practical knowledge as possible. 
The Centre released a brochure featuring course descriptions and seminar programmes twice a year. The courses were listed according to their respective themes:
<br>Systematic and applicative software: Informatics, Languages, Information Tools, User Applications, Education and Computer Science, Users and Informatics. 
<br>Systems: Operating Systems, Communications, Apparatus Equipment, Input-Output Units, Computer Systems.
<br>Other Skills: Economic and Juridical Skills, Management Politics and Organisation, Sociological Skills, The Work Environment, Live Languages, and Special Services.
