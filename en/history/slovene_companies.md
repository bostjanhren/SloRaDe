# Slovene Companies and the First Days of Delta

When the information revolution began shaping the world, the list of the most important
agents involved included companies such as IBM, DEC, Apple, Commodore, Sinclair, and
Microsoft. Slovenia (at the time a part of Yugoslavia), however, was home to Iskra Delta, a
company that matched the vision of the other tech giants, as well as other companies that
manufactured computers and terminals such as Tovarna meril (Measurements Factory),
Gorenje, which in 1980 developed the Gorenje Dialog computer, and KOPA, which in 1982
made the KOPA 2500 computer. And even before Iskra Delta, a state-run company named
Elektrotehna specialised in selling electrotechnical products to Yugoslav companies.
Elektrotehna linked up with the American company DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation)
with the goal of selling computers across Yugoslavia. A department of Elektrotehna was
renamed Digital and specialised in the selling of computers for the management of industrial
processes and institutes of development, devices for managing business procedures later also
being added to the catalogue. In 1977 the department outgrew its original purpose and became
an independent and specialised computer company named Delta, while still under the
jurisdiction of Elektrotehna. Delta also had an agreement with DEC which supplied them with
only the most integral components, while other components (for charging and cooling),
casing, and applicative software were manufactured by Delta itself. Because Delta employed
an educated and experienced workforce, members of which studied at the Department of
Computer and Information Science at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, the Department
of Digital Engineering at the Jo≈æef Stefan Institute, and the Department for the Representation
of Foreign Companies at the Slovene commercial company Elektrotehna, the company
developed and grew very quickly and in 1977 manufactured its first computer which they
named Delta 340.
