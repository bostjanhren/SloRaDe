The Iskradata 80, or ID80 for short, is a distributed computer system developed and manufactured in 1979 and 1980 by the Iskra Computers BOAL in Kranj, in cooperation with German company ADPS. ID80 was a microcomputer with a modular design which made it easily adaptable to the user’s demands. It was released in the following forms:

 - Iskradata 80-50 - Writer, system with printer
 - Iskradata 80-60 - Independent work station
 - Iskradata 80-70 - Communicative work station
 - Iskradata 80-75 - Synchronous terminal
 - Iskradata 80-80 - Independent registry system
 - Iskradata 80-90 - Communicative registry system

The distributed processing enabled access to a database of another computer in the network. A computer could have been used independently or, by using the communicative module, in a network of up to 16 computers connected as working stations. Work stations were connected via the RS-232 bus and communicated through synchronous or asynchronous protocols, which also enabled control over the transfers.

The computer used the IDOS or the CP/M operating system and ran on the Basic and Pascal computer languages. The registry computer could read up to 4 disc units up to 300 MB.
