# Lesser-known computers of Slovene origin

<br>

Listed below are some of the lesser-known computers and terminals of Slovene origin, namely those on which we could gather enough information. Naturally, other devices or different compositions of listed devices exist, but are not listed as we could not gather enough information or were not aware of them at the time of creating this portal.

●	**KOPA**

In 1978 the KOPA Video Terminals labour unit created the KOPA 700 video terminal. A year later they unveiled the KOPA 1000 terminal at the Interbiro – Informatika fair in Zagreb. In 1980 they linked up with DELTA and began developing applications for the new KOPA 1500 terminals. In 1982 they began cooperating with the Jožef Stefan Institute in developing the KOPA 2500 microcomputer, which ran on the CP/M operating system, while at the same time developing the APL accounting system. The KOPA Terminals BOAL was soon founded and was responsible for developing the KOPA 3500, 4500, 5500, and 6500. The new form of the company was focused on development and linked up with the Oracle company. In 1989 the company was reformed again and named Computer Engineering KOPA. A year later they unveiled the UNIX family of systems at the Elektronika fair in Ljubljana.



●	**Iskradata 100**

Iskradata 100 is a 16-bit development system created by the Kranj Computers BOAL in 1982. It enables the programming of the Motorola 68000 and Zilog 80 microprocessors in the Basic and Pascal languages. The central processing module of the computer was developed based on the family of 68000 processors with the direct addressing of 16 MB and the speed of 16 MHZ. It contains 16 KB of the RAM/EPROM memory, as well as a temporal, interrupt, and control logic. It used the static RAM or EPROM memory of 32 KB with parity control and the DRAM memory of 512 KB with single-error correction. The bus-logic analyser enabled the testing of programmes in real time. 



●	**Iskradata 80** 

The Iskradata 80 computers are a family of systems for distributed processing. Many different versions exist because the system was modular and could therefore be adapted according to the user’s needs. 1–16 work stations could be connected to the master computer which had an expandable memory with up to 4 disc units. The RS 232-V24 interface enabled the connecting of peripheral devices. 


Listed below are some of the Iskradata 80 modules and their purposes of use:
- Iskradata 80-50 Writer
- Iskradata 80-60 Independent work station
- Iskradata 80-70 Communicative work station
- Iskradata 80-75 Synchronous terminal
- Iskradata 80-80 Independent registry system
- Iskradata 80-90 Communicative registry system



●	**DELTA** 

- The DELTA 340 was developed in 1978 and presented to president Tito on his birthday. Along with the Delta 644, 700, and 400, it marked the beginning of the production of homemade mini and supermini computers.
- The DELTA 4780 ran on the VAX 11/780 processor and the Delta V operating system. 
- The DELTA 4850 ran on the VAX 11/750 processor and the Delta V operating system.



●	**GEMINI**

The Gemini was a 32-bit multiprocessor system developed by Iskra Delta. It enabled pairs of 16 or 32-bit processors to be bunched together. Iskra Delta had another multiprocessor system in the catalogue – the Delta 4860.
