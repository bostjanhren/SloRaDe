The Paka 2000 terminal was created by Gorenje in 1982 with Iskra Delta overseeing its marketing and promotion.  To manufacture it, a motherboard developed by US company Mostek was used.

The keyboard was connected to the monitor via a 1.5 m coil. LED lights on the keyboard meant the computer was able to send error feedback and show which application-specific operations were turned on. These operations could be executed simultaneously with one click on the keyboard.

The monitor’s 132-column display enabled the computer to print documents with no need to readjust the data (the data printed looked the same as the data shown on the monitor). Worth noting is also the monitor’s ability to divide the display. Some of the lines could be frozen, while the user could still work on the rest of the lines. Each character was shown on a 7x9 matrix/stencil on a 9x10 array/field. The monitor was able to display upper- and lower-case letters, double-width letters, and double-size letters. Along with the usual characters (numbers, letters, etc.), it also contained 39 bar codes used to display graphic information. Besides the main plug-in, the monitor also contained a printer plug-in.

The terminal itself only contained two buttons, one to turn it on and the other to control the power supply. The rest of the settings were adjustable via the keyboard and saved on a special memory.
