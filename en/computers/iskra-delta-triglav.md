The basis of the Triglav (Trident) computer was the VME bus which was often seen in 32-bit computers. The bus enabled a simple installation of dedicated modules made by other manufacturers. The computer was available in 3 versions, each featuring one of the three processors: Intel 80286, Motorola 68010, or DEC J11. To enable calculations with the floating point, it featured an additional compressor.

The Triglav (Trident) featured a graphical module which enabled the resolution of 1024 x 1024 dots. Each dot could be coloured by one of the 16 colours chosen from the range of 265 colours. The text was saved separately and the characters could be displayed in eight different colours.

Because the computer ran on one of three well-known processors, it could support all of the most prominent operating systems: UCSD-p, CP/M-68K, MS-DOS, CONCURRENT-DOS, UNIX, XENIX, RT-11, and DELTA-M. This meant it could run a wide range of the then-existing software and support all of the most important computer languages: C, Fortran, Pascal, Cobol, and Basic.

Each module was intended for a different type of user. The Intel processor configuration was intended as a computer for business, as the Unix version could be simultaneously used by 8 users, while the MS-DOS version supported all IBM PC programmes. The Motorola processor configuration ran on either the Unix or the CP/M 68K operating system and was meant to be used for constructing by computer. The third configuration, running on the DEC processor and RT-11 operating system, was intended as a computer for process management and was adaptable to the user’s needs, as other manufacturer’s modules could be installed onto it.
