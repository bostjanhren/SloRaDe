- CPU: Zilog Z80A (models: H, 20, P) or Hitachi HD64180 (model: M)
- RAM: 64 kB (could be expanded to 256 kB on the P model or 512 on the M model)
- ROM: 16 kB
- Operating System: FEDOS or FENIX
- Option of expansion (e.g. by adding a graphics card)

The Dialog computer series are a family of 8-bit microcomputers, developed by the Computer Structures and Systems Laboratory (CSSL) at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Ljubljana (today the Laboratory resides at the Faculty of Computer and Information Science) for the needs of the Processing Equipment LO, Gorenje.

The goal of the project was to create an affordable computer which could be used for the internal needs of Gorenje (business applications, office work, repair, laboratory instruments guidance, process measurement), but could also be used by the public. The latter did not come to fruition due to the low number of Dialog computers produced.

Four different models of the Dialog were created. Dialog H is a home model featuring FEBASIC, a home implementation of the then-popular computer language BASIC, integrated in the ROM. The other models ran on FEDOS, which is a home equivalent of the then-popular CP/M 2.2 operating system and therefore enables the computer to run many foreign and homemade programmes developed for CP/M.

The multiuser operating system FENIX was developed to be used on the Dialog P and Dialog M. It enabled up to 16 Dialogs to be connected via the DanteNet network also developed at CSSL.

The software and a big portion of the hardware was manufactured in Slovenia: printed circuit, keyboard, passive components, computer case, display. Integrated circuits (microchips) and disk drives were imported.

The P and M models could be expanded by adding an additional memory, the IEEE 488 standard interface, a network interface, and a colour graphics card with 16 colours (from a range of 256) and the resolution of 256x256. 

The project was stopped when Iskra Delta merged with the Gorenje COAL, as the Dialog’s performance levels were very similar to Delta’s Partner. Both could also run the programmes designed for CP/M.
