The Partner computer series are a family of desktop computers that were created to be small business and/or development systems.

Several different models were manufactured. They all share the same basic features but differ in their extensions.  On a basic level, we can differentiate between the older version, which could only display text, and the newer version, to which an additional graphics board with a resolution of 1024x512 dots was added. Both versions were equipped with either one or two floppy-disk drives, or with one floppy-disk drive and a hard drive (10 MB).  

All Partners are equipped with at least one serial port (RS–232–C) so that a printer, mouse, or tablet could be connected, while two more ports could be installed. Other expansions featured were the Centronics connector, network connector, and television output. 

Out of all Slovene computers, the Partner boasts with the highest number of devices produced (a few thousand). Its production at first took place in Kranj but was later moved to Ptuj.
