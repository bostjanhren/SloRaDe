# Our goal and activities

In a world dominated by computer technology most frequently developed in western and manufactured in eastern countries, few can imagine there once was a time when Slovenia (at the time a part of Yugoslavia) was among the most important developers of information technology. The 1980s and 1990s were decades when a number of Slovene computers, along with hardware and software, were developed and produced.

It is hard for one to find detailed information on the technology developed at that time, while detailed technical specifications and related literature are even more scarce. Furthermore, most of these computers and related hardware no longer exist, only a handful (usually no longer functioning) devices can be found on the shelves of collectors and other enthusiasts. Some of the reasons for this are that the computers were not produced in large quantities, they were mostly intended for business use, and the breakthrough of personal computers (PCs) putting an end to their development.

The main goal of the project is to save the computer technology developed in Slovenia in the last century from being forgotten. As physically saving the equipment and technology is unlikely due to its rapid aging, our focus is on making an inventory of existing hardware, software, and other relevant sources of information, digitalising relevant literature, and talking with people involved in the development of Slovene information technology. The gathered information has been distilled and is publicly available on this portal.

# Support

The project was financially backed by the  [the Public Scholarship, Development, Disability and Maintenance Fund of the Republic of Slovenia](http://www.sklad-kadri.si). It spanned 4 months, from March to June 2018, and was overseen by the [Faculty of Computer and Information Science ](https://fri.uni-lj.si) of the [University of Ljubljana](https://www.uni-lj.si/) in cooperation with [The Museum and Galleries of Ljubljana](https://mgml.si/sl/). 10 students of at least four different courses of study participated in the project, each of them contributing the equivalent of a month’s work.
