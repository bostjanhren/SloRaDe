# Examples of computer use
Due to Iskra Delta’s success the only data available to us is that of the use of Delta’s
computers. The text mostly features applications and software that could have been uploaded
on almost any DELTA system computer. Singled out are the uses of the PARTNER,
TRIGLAV (TRIDENT), and ISKRADATA 1680 computers, which were the most popular and
user-friendly. In its use-information bulletins, Iskra Delta stresses that any programme can be
easily learned if users attend the company’s courses in the use of computers and Delta
systems at their education centre in Nova Gorica.
All the information listed is taken out of material found at NUK (National and University
Library) ([Iskra Delta : informativno gradivo], umetna zbirka. Ljubljana : Iskra Delta, 1982-
1988.)
List of Iskra Delta computer systems’ applications and software used in production, offices
and homes:
- Textile industry – tailoring optimisation system (system of automatic tailoring –
computer package)
- System of chipboard production control
- Technical applications for use in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries
- Computer guidance of lumber, paper, and textile industry processes
- Food industry
- Weather radar (DELTA 800), Obramba pred točo (Hail Defence) programme system
- Applicative solutions in the field of civil service: tax bookkeeping, citizen registries,
accounts of communal services, social security
- Purchase and selling functions: the Nabava (Purchase), Zaloge (Supply), and Prodaja
(Sales) applications
- Tourism and catering – Recepcijsko poslovanje (Reception Management) application
model
- Banking
- Educational purposes: PARTNER and TRIGLAV (TRIDENT) were gifted to schools
as tools of teaching information and computer science, getting used to working with
computers, and learning computer languages and programming. If used with the
appropriate equipment, microcomputers may be used in teaching other subjects (Civil

Engineering, Chemistry, Engineering, Agriculture). They enable the simulation of
different processes, interactive learning and teacher-student communication,
independent work on computers, and regular and objective assessment of students.
They also enable the automatization of school management – keeping records of
teachers and students, forming timetables, and automatically displaying student
performance.
