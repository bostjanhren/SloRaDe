### Slovene Companies and the First Days of Delta
When the information revolution began shaping the world, the list of the most important
agents involved included companies such as IBM, DEC, Apple, Commodore, Sinclair, and
Microsoft. Slovenia (at the time a part of Yugoslavia), however, was home to Iskra Delta, a
company that matched the vision of the other tech giants, as well as other companies that
manufactured computers and terminals such as Tovarna meril (Measurements Factory),
Gorenje, which in 1980 developed the Gorenje Dialog computer, and KOPA, which in 1982
made the KOPA 2500 computer. And even before Iskra Delta, a state-run company named
Elektrotehna specialised in selling electrotechnical products to Yugoslav companies.
Elektrotehna linked up with the American company DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation)
with the goal of selling computers across Yugoslavia. A department of Elektrotehna was
renamed Digital and specialised in the selling of computers for the management of industrial
processes and institutes of development, devices for managing business procedures later also
being added to the catalogue. In 1977 the department outgrew its original purpose and became
an independent and specialised computer company named Delta, while still under the
jurisdiction of Elektrotehna. Delta also had an agreement with DEC which supplied them with
only the most integral components, while other components (for charging and cooling),
casing, and applicative software were manufactured by Delta itself. Because Delta employed
an educated and experienced workforce, members of which studied at the Department of
Computer and Information Science at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, the Department
of Digital Engineering at the Jožef Stefan Institute, and the Department for the Representation
of Foreign Companies at the Slovene commercial company Elektrotehna, the company

developed and grew very quickly and in 1977 manufactured its first computer which they
named Delta 340.
The Impact of Delta in Yugoslavia
The computer was made according to an original design and configuration, the only DEC
components it featured being its PDP processor and its operating software, while other
components were made by Delta itself or purchased from other global suppliers. Having its
own applicative software and homegrown electronic solutions enabled Delta to avoid licence
fees that were present in the development of former computers. Despite that, the Delta 340
computer was compatible with DEC computers. Members of Delta were now faced with an
even harder task – successfully selling the product and asserting themselves as a company,
manufacturing computers made exclusively in Yugoslavia. 1978 saw them perform an
enormous marketing move, presenting the computer to Tito on his birthday. To mark the
occasion, they developed a programme which upon presentation started playing the national
anthem of Yugoslavia and displayed Tito’s portrait on the monitor. The stunt was extremely
successful and won over Tito’s affection which was instrumental in their survival in the
following months. Soon after that same year Delta separated itself from Elektrotehna and
instead started linking up with Iskra and Gorenje to form a company named Iskra Delta. The
personnel coming into the company from Iskra enabled it to grow at an even higher pace. So
much so it soon had its own sales and repairs centres all across Yugoslavia. Their success was
based on their efforts to form a close relationship with the users of their products.
International Success
As early as 1980, Iskra Delta founded a New York delegation and made contacts with
American suppliers, and so was in touch with the latest achievements in development in the
Silicon Valley. The firm developed two new computers, Partner and Triglav (in international
markets known as Trident), and in 1984 became the first to realise a project of a computer
managing and running a hydroelectric power station from a distance. Its computers were also
involved in the realisation of sporting events, such as ski jumping in Planica, skiing
competitions in Kranjska Gora and Maribor, and the Winter Universiade in Czechoslovakia.
Their cooperation granted the events full informational support, a record of participants, and
the collecting and distribution of results at different locations.
During their peak years, the company conscientiously presented their products at Interbiro
fairs in Ljubljana and Zagreb and thus attracted many foreign clients. It was at such a fair in

1984 that Iskra Delta’s products enthralled representatives of the People’s Republic of China,
who wanted to collaborate on a project which would connect the police stations of the ten
largest cities in China via computer. Iskra Delta agreed to the cooperation and in 1986
successfully realised the enormous project. While the project bonded the two countries and
was the largest purchase China had ever made in Yugoslavia, it experienced certain
complications. This cooperation between Yugoslavia and China also attracted the attention of
Chinese and other eastern countries’ intelligence services.
