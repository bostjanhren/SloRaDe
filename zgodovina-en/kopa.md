# Kopa

Kopa is a company founded in Slovenj Gradec, which operated as part of the Plastika BOAL
under the jurisdiction of the Slovenijales LO. At first, they were focused on producing video
terminals, but soon also began developing applicative software and formed a close connection
with Delta Computer Systems. They left their footprint in Slovenia’s computer heritage in
1982 when they, in collaboration with the Jožef Stefan Institute, developed the
microcomputer Kopa 2500 and presented it at the Interbiro fair in Zagreb. In the following
years, Kopa continued developing video terminals and applicative software, enhanced their
already existing products, and in 1984 developed the Kopa 3500 microcomputer featuring a
new CPU, the performance of which they continued to enhance in the following years. 1991
did not only bring an end to Yugoslavia as a country but also as a market, which led Croatian
and Serbian companies to end their trade with Kopa, which nevertheless remained a reliable
partner in producing computer-supported information systems. In 1994 the company linked
up with Compaq and in the next few years gained 30 Slovene partners. They continue
developing software and again break through onto the market of former Yugoslav countries.
2018 marks the 40 th anniversary of Kopa.
